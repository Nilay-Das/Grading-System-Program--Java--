# Grading-System-Program-(Java)
This program calculates the final grades of students and also calculates the class averages and class medians.

The program is divided into three problem files. The description of each problem file and the inputs and outputs are as follows:

--Problem 1--

This problem calculates the final grade of a student by calculating the scores of particular assessments.

Input:
B00123456 90 95 100 85 90 90 99 10 100 95 100 100 98

Output:
Student: B00123456 - A+


--Problem-2--

This program reads the assessment scores of multiple students and calculates their final grade. This program also calculates the class averages of each assessment.

Input:
3
B00123456 90 95 100 85 90 90 99 10 100 95 100 100 98
B00408996 30 12 45 40 90 30 45 60 55 65 32 80 50
B00989439 85 80 79 90 80 77 88 90 87 96 81 83 80

Output:
B00123456 A+
B00408996 D
B00989439 A
Class Averages:
Tests: 68.44 - Assignments: 78.92 - Practicums: 81.17 - PoDs: 76.00
